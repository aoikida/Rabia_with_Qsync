This directory contains the proof scripts for the core weak Multivalued
consensus part of the Rabia protocol. The proof is split into two parts in two
systems, one in Ivy and one in Coq. The former proof establishes invariants of
each round of the protocol. Using these invariants as assumptions, the Coq
proof shows that these imply the expected consensus properties.

The proof scripts are known to work with Ivy commit version 83d08ee and Coq
version 8.13.2.

If you happen to have (close) versions of those installed, you can check the
files directly by doing:

```coqc coq/weak_mvc.v```

and

```ivy_check macro_finder=false seed=1 isolate=protocol trace=true ivy/weak_mvc.ivy```

respectively.

If you don't have those installed, Docker scripts are included for building ivy
and coq.  To check each proof with these docker containers, you can `cd` into
the respective subdirectory and execute the `run.sh` scripts in each.
