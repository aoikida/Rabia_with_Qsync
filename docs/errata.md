1. We have a typo on page 12 in paragraph "Throughput vs. Latency:" "The maximum batch size is 1000, 5000, and **300**, for EPaxos,
Paxos, and Rabia, respectively. " should be changed to "The maximum batch size is 1000, 5000, and **200**, for EPaxos,
Paxos, and Rabia, respectively. " Thanks to Hao Lu from Zhejiang University, China for pointing that out!
