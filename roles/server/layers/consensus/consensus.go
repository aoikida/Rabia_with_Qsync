	The consensus package defines the struct of a consensus instance and methods shared by the consensus executor and
	the message handler. Both routines modify states in the server Ledger, but the executor follows the pseudo-code of
	Rabia. The handler does the dirty work that is not described in the pseudo-code -- basically, send and receive
	messages on the behalf of this executor (but the proposal request and reply phase is an exception). See descriptions
	in executor.go and msg_handler.go for more details.

	Note:

	1. The implemented code for deciding each slot is somewhat different from the algorithm in our paper; The
	implementation follows a more verbose version of the algorithm presented in the SOSP paper, see the document in the
	docs folder

/*
	Race Conditions Documented

	The correct execution of Rabia assumes a few timing issues documented below never occur. In fact, given the
	right/default user parameters, these issues are extremely unlikely to happen and they never happened in any
	testing or benchmarking runs.

	Why we claim they virtually cannot occur:

	These timing issues are there because we use a circular ring buffer, and when one of the MsgHandler/Executor resets
	a slot while the other access to the slot, problematic results may get returned. Since our default configuration
	assumes a long ledger (10000+ slots), slots are reset are far away from slots are currently accessed, those timing
	issues never had a chance to occur.

	Two cases where race condition may occur (extremely unlikely by the default parameter):

	1. In MsgHandler's function binConMsgHandling(), the routine may call UpdateTermIfNecessary(), which may reset the
	slot X. However, the Executor may call putBackMyProposal() in the epilogue() function, which may access fields of
	slot X.

	2. In Executor's function getRequest(), the routine may call UpdateTermIfNecessary(), which may reset the slot X.
	However, the MsgHandler may access slot X after when it receives a ProposalRequest.

	How to eradicate this issue:

	When modifying or reading Term, IsDone, and Decision fields, acquire Slot.lock first to avoid concurrent writing,
	undesirable resetting or data overriding. The downside of this modification is this may slow down Rabia. In future
	versions of Rabia, we will tackle this issue.
